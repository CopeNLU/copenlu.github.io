In addition to this, Copenhagen is a lively, bustling capital, while still being small enough that one can cycle nearly everwhere within a short amount of time. Intrigued? Read on!\n Life in Copenhagen NLP Research at the University of Copenhagen Applying for a PhD Doing a Postdoc CopeNLU Group Visiting the Group  Life in Copenhagen Copenhagen is lively and vibrant, yet comfortably-sized capital city by the North Sea on the border to Sweden with an oceanic climate. As it is located in Scandinavia, many of the corresponding stereotypes apply. Healthcare is socialised, public transport is cheap, working hours are short, taxes are high, but so are incomes. Denmark has been voted the happiest country in the world in 2016 and has kept a spot in the top three since, becoming a world-wide cultural phenomenon with many books published on the topic (some personal recommendations: \u0026ldquo;The Year of Living Danishly\u0026rdquo; by Helen Russell, and \u0026ldquo;The Almost Nearly Perfect People\u0026rdquo; by Michael Booth). Popular exports are hygge, beer and pork products.\nLiving in Copenhagen itself is a very relaxing experience. The city is very spacious compared to other capitals (think: London, New York, Tokyo), boasting large and open public spaces. Most people cycle to work and have a short commute, as it is easily possible to afford a city centre flat on an average salary. There are many things to do and explore in Copenhagen, from cozy bars and caf√©s to museums, the hipster district Vesterbro, the free town Christiania, and much more, as Copenhagen has incidentally also been voted the number 1 city to visit by Lonely Planet. The Copenhagen tourist board as well as the EMNLP 2017 local guide are excellent starting points for finding out more about what to do.\n         NLP Research at the University of Copenhagen The University of Copenhagen is currently home to three NLP faculty members and many postdocs and PhD students, who work on topics including natural language understanding, parsing, multi-lingual aspects, low-resource learning, machine translation and multi-modal learning.\nNLP at the University of Copenhagen as a whole is highly productive and internationally well-regarded. For instance, we are ranked 2nd in Europe and 14th in the world on CSRankings for NLP) since the beginning of NLP research activities at the University of Copenhagen in 2013, and were host to EMNLP 2017.\nApplying for a PhD PhD programs at the University of Copenhagen, and in Denmark in general, are fairly compact; students are expected to submit their thesis after three years, while an extension of one year can be granted. PhD students do not have to take courses during their studies, as they are expected to have completed a Master\u0026rsquo;s degree already. There are benefits and downsides to such a program structure, of course, and a more opinionated take on this can be found in this Quora post.\nThere are generally three routes to applying for a PhD:\n applying for a fully-funded position; applying with external funding; applying for an industrial PhD.  The first option is undoubtedly the most common one. Therein, a PhD fellowship is provided through a funded project, and the position is advertised on the KU job portal. The successful candidate becomes an employee at the University of Copenhagen, and in addition a PhD candidate registered with the PhD School. Depending on the funding source, a broad research topic is either already provided, or the topic is completely open.\nThe second option requires the PhD candidate to have already secured funding to cover living expenses in Denmark for a three-year period. Funding can, for instance, come from a governmental scholarship program such as CSC. The candidate then contacts the potential advisor, and given a positive resonse applies for admission to the PhD School afterwards.\nThe third option is something fairly special to Denmark \u0026ndash; PhD students can study towards their PhD, while working at a company at the same time roughly one day a week. These PhD projects tend to be more applied and the topic for them is defined based on an agreement between the PhD advisor and the company. Funding for such projects is either agreed upon with or without a candidate for the position. As with the other two options, the PhD student is enrolled at the Doctoral School.\nMore information on the enrollment process at the Science Faculty Doctoral School is listed here.\nDoing a Postdoc Postdoc positions are available for anything between one and four years. Applicants are expected to have submitted their PhD thesis by the time they start, but it is typically not necessary for them to have been formally awarded a PhD yet, if they have sufficient evidence that this is likely to happen in the near future.\nThe routes to getting a postdoc position are very similar to those for a PhD position:\n applying for a fully-funded position; applying with external funding; applying for an industrial PhD.  Funded postdoc positions are often advertised on the KU job portal, though 1-year postdoc contracts can be offered without open calls. The postdoc topic varies widely based on the funding source.\nIt is, furthermore, possible to start as a postdoc with already obtained funding, e.g. individual research fellowships. The topic for those is typically open and decided by the postdoc candidate. For some fellowship schemes, applications are made jointly with the host. Get in touch if you are interested in this option.\nLastly, industrial postdoc programs means a researcher works both at a university and at a company, roughly one day a week. The postdoc topic is typically more application-oriented and defined based on an agreement between the advisor and the company. Funding is either agreed upon with or without a candidate for the position.\nCopeNLU Group If you arrived on this page, you\u0026rsquo;ve likely already seen the rest of the CopeNLU website. We are a young research group at the Computer Science department at the University of Copenhagen, interested in natural language understanding. We are a very social and collaborative group, with weekly group meetings, breakfasts and reading groups, in addition to one-on-one adviser-advisee meetings. PhD students and postdocs are encouraged to not work on projects on their own, but rather form synergies with other group members based on common research interests.\nVisiting the Group We are always open to short or longer-term visitors to the group, but do not provide internships for Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s or Master\u0026rsquo;s students. Funding for visits can typically not be provided, with the expection of invited speakers who give a talk in the Copenhagen NLP meetup series.\n","date":1549062000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549062000,"objectID":"dfe14b7cff1dd6a8394505f419e3da78","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/post/why-ucph/","publishdate":"2019-02-02T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/why-ucph/","section":"post","summary":"The University of Copenhagen is a great place if you're both interested in high-quality NLP research and a high quality of life.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Interested in joining us at the University of Copenhagen?","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548000421,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548000421,"objectID":"95e81310bc3161eac19de3719bf77d94","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/people/isabelle/","publishdate":"2019-01-20T17:07:01+01:00","relpermalink":"/people/isabelle/","section":"people","summary":"","tags":["Members"],"title":"Isabelle Augenstein","type":"people"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1547914141,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547914141,"objectID":"6b65be908a86e77256fbcbf4a3629746","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/people/johannes/","publishdate":"2019-01-19T17:09:01+01:00","relpermalink":"/people/johannes/","section":"people","summary":"","tags":["Members"],"title":"Johannes Bjerva","type":"people"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1547914021,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547914021,"objectID":"9dec93e26a79a922ecb78073404d2edb","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/people/pepa/","publishdate":"2019-01-19T17:07:01+01:00","relpermalink":"/people/pepa/","section":"people","summary":"","tags":["Members"],"title":"Pepa Atanasova","type":"people"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1547827621,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547827621,"objectID":"98cc91b01a3eb7447fa8509572706287","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/people/newphd/","publishdate":"2019-01-18T17:07:01+01:00","relpermalink":"/people/newphd/","section":"people","summary":"","tags":["Members"],"title":"NN PhD Student","type":"people"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1547741221,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547741221,"objectID":"5e82376c2db939241c73c98ea3326c8b","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/people/giannis/","publishdate":"2019-01-17T17:07:01+01:00","relpermalink":"/people/giannis/","section":"people","summary":"","tags":["Members"],"title":"Giannis Bekoulis","type":"people"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1547654821,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547654821,"objectID":"8f7ec6df3ddaddd23752a710340e1517","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/people/luna/","publishdate":"2019-01-16T17:07:01+01:00","relpermalink":"/people/luna/","section":"people","summary":"","tags":["Members"],"title":"Luna De Bruyne","type":"people"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1547568421,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547568421,"objectID":"4a0551a8f7326bd863d21e9e474d8410","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/people/farhad/","publishdate":"2019-01-15T17:07:01+01:00","relpermalink":"/people/farhad/","section":"people","summary":"","tags":["Members"],"title":"Farhad Nooralahzadeh","type":"people"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536444000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536444000,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Johannes Bjerva","Isabelle Augenstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530396000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530396000,"objectID":"fe858a5d667bd2b84a2bc2dbd7792726","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2017_naacl_bjerva/","publishdate":"2018-07-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_naacl_bjerva/","section":"publication","summary":"A core part of linguistic typology is the classification of languages according to linguistic properties, such as those detailed in the World Atlas of Language Structure (WALS). Doing this manually is prohibitively time-consuming, which is in part evidenced by the fact that only 100 out of over 7,000 languages spoken in the world are fully covered in WALS. We learn distributed language representations, which can be used to predict typological properties on a massively multilingual scale. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses of these language embeddings can tell us how language similarities are encoded in NLP models for tasks at different typological levels. The representations are learned in an unsupervised manner alongside tasks at three typological levels: phonology (grapheme-to-phoneme prediction, and phoneme reconstruction), morphology (morphological inflection), and syntax (part-of-speech tagging). We consider more than 800 languages and find significant differences in the language representations encoded, depending on the target task. For instance, although Norwegian Bokmal and Danish are typologically close to one another, they are phonologically distant, which is reflected in their language embeddings growing relatively distant in a phonological task. We are also able to predict typological features in WALS with high accuracies, even for unseen language families.","tags":[],"title":"From Phonology to Syntax: Unsupervised Linguistic Typology at Different Levels with Language Embeddings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Isabelle Augenstein","Sebastian Ruder","Anders S√∏gaard"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530396000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530396000,"objectID":"28fccb98e5dc1cf72fb9e24a77790834","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2017_naacl_augenstein/","publishdate":"2018-07-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_naacl_augenstein/","section":"publication","summary":"We combine multi-task learning and semisupervised learning by inducing a joint embedding space between disparate label spaces and learning transfer functions between label embeddings, enabling us to jointly leverage unlabelled data and auxiliary, annotated datasets.

By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target.

From the query image, the person is detected, clothing is segmented, and clothing features are extracted and quantized. The information is sent from the phone client to a server, where the feature vector of the query image is used to retrieve similar clothing products from online databases. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location. State of the art work focuses primarily on the recognition of a diverse range of clothing offline and pays little attention to practical applications. Evaluated on a challenging dataset, the system is relatively fast and achieves promising results.","tags":[],"title":"Mobile visual clothing search","type":"publication_backup"}]
